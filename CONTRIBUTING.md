# Contributing

To make contributions to this charm, you'll need a working [development setup](https://juju.is/docs/sdk/dev-setup).

You can create an environment for development with `tox`:

```shell
tox devenv -e integration
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Testing

This project uses `tox` for managing test environments. There are some pre-configured environments
that can be used for linting and formatting code when you're preparing contributions to the charm:

* `tox`: Runs all of the basic checks (`lint`, `unit`, `static`, and `coverage-report`).
* `tox -e fmt`: Runs formatting using `black` and `isort`.
* `tox -e lint`: Runs a range of static code analysis to check the code.
* `tox -e static`: Runs other checks such as `bandit` for security issues.
* `tox -e unit`: Runs the unit tests.
* `tox -e integration`: Runs the integration tests.

## Build the charm
