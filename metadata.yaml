  A [Juju](https://juju.is/) [charm](https://juju.is/docs/olm/charmed-operators)
  deploying and managing a DNS server Integrator on Kubernetes and bare metal.

  This charm simplifies configuration of a DNS server client by providing a single point
  of configuration for all the requirers using the same DNS server. It can be
  deployed on many different Kubernetes platforms, from [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io)
  to [Charmed Kubernetes](https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes), public cloud Kubernetes
  offerings and virtual machines or bare metal.

  As such, the charm makes it easy to manage and propagate DNS configuration, while
  giving the freedom to deploy on the substrate of their choice.

  For DevOps or SRE teams this charm will make operating any charm requiring dynamic DNS
  configuration simple and straightforward through Juju's clean interface.
